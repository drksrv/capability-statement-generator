2. **Test on TestPyPI First (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Install twine if not already installed
   pip install twine

   # Upload to TestPyPI first
   twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   
   # Test installation from TestPyPI
   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ capability-statement-generator
   ```

3. **Upload to Production PyPI:**
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

4. **After Publishing:**
   - Users can install with: `pip install capability-statement-generator`
   - Run with command: `capability-statement`

### 3. 🐳 Docker Hub (Containerized Distribution)

- Deploy on company cloud infrastructure

## 🔧 Advanced Publishing Features

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
```yaml
name: Publish Package

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install setuptools wheel twine
    - name: Build package
      run: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
      run: twine upload dist/*
```

### Documentation Site

**Using GitHub Pages:**
1. Create `docs/` folder
2. Add detailed documentation
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Use Jekyll or MkDocs for professional documentation

### Version Management

**Semantic Versioning:**
